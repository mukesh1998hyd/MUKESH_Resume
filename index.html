                    <p><strong>Project Description:</strong><br>
                    This project focuses on deploying a website with high availability and resilience. The goal is to ensure that the website remains operational and performs well even in the face of failures or high traffic. By using a combination of AWS services, this deployment will be able to handle traffic spikes, prevent single points of failure, and ensure consistent performance.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Aspects:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>High Availability:</strong> The website will be designed to remain available and operational across multiple regions and Availability Zones. This involves using services like Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute traffic and Auto Scaling to handle varying loads.</li>
                    </ul>
